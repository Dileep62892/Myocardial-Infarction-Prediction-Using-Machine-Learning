# Myocardial Infarction Prediction Using ML Algorithms

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) based on various medical parameters. Utilizing a range of machine learning classification algorithms, we assess the risk factors and predict future heart attack occurrences with a focus on accuracy and early detection.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleansing and preparing data for analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most significant factors contributing to heart attacks.
- **Model Training**: Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of each algorithm to select the best predictor.
- **Prediction**: Estimating the probability of a heart attack for new patients.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Getting Started
To run this project, please follow the steps below:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the models.
3. Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
To predict myocardial infarction risk, input the patient's medical parameters into the model. The output will be the predicted risk category.
